/// The shared latest-wins decode-worker engine behind the asynchronous
/// MediaSource implementations (ImagePipelineSource, StreamingVideoSource).
///
/// One dedicated thread serves decode requests with latest-target-wins
/// coalescing: requests posted while a decode is in flight overwrite the
/// pending target, keeping the queue at depth one regardless of slider drag
/// rate. Results flow through a single-slot mailbox (`deposit()` / `take()`),
/// and an optional frame-ready callback fires after every deposit so pull-only
/// consumers know to re-poll.
///
/// Threading contract (mirrors the MediaSource contract it serves):
///  - `start()`, `requestDecode()`, `invalidate()`, `take()`, and
///    `setFrameReadyCallback()` are main-thread-only.
///  - The DecodeFn runs on the internal worker thread. It may call
///    `deposit()` any number of times per request (e.g. an instant scrub
///    preview followed by the settled full-res frame).
///  - The frame-ready callback is invoked FROM the worker thread, outside the
///    result lock; implementers must hop to their own thread.
///
/// Exception barrier: a DecodeFn that throws does not kill the worker (and
/// cannot escape the std::thread callable, which would std::terminate). The
/// exception is routed to the OnDecodeError hook and the loop keeps serving —
/// see ARCHITECTURE.md §10.5.
///
/// Teardown: the destructor (or an explicit `stop()`) flips the running flag
/// UNDER the request mutex before notifying — an unlocked store can land
/// between the worker's predicate check and its block, so the notify wakes
/// nobody and the join hangs (the historical scene2d_dock_widget_test
/// deadlock, previously fixed separately in each source). When cancellation
/// is enabled the in-flight token is cancelled too, so a slow (4K GOP) decode
/// is preempted rather than blocking teardown.
