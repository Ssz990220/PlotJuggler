# Release AppImage — embedded (compiled) plugin flavor

The **release CI** (`.github/workflows/linux-appimage-release.yml`, see
[`README.md`](./README.md)) bundles the curated plugin set by **downloading the
published marketplace zips** from `pj-plugin-registry`
(`build_appimage.sh --plugins-registry`) — the same artifacts the Windows
installer ships.

This document covers the **local alternative**: compiling the same curated set
from `pj-official-plugins` source and embedding it.
[`build_release_appimage.sh`](./build_release_appimage.sh) orchestrates that
full build. Use it when the registry is not an option — offline builds, testing
unpublished plugin changes, or building against a not-yet-released SDK.

## The full bundled set (17 + ROS 2)

| Loaders | Parsers | Streams | Toolboxes |
|---|---|---|---|
| csv, mcap, parquet, ulog, mp4, pointcloud-3d | ros, protobuf, json, data-tamer | dummy-streamer, foxglove-bridge, plotjuggler-bridge, webrtc-client, ros2-topic-subscriber | quaternion, transform-editor, mosaico |

(Excluded by request: `toolbox-colormap`, `toolbox-reactive-scripts-editor`.
The set matches `BUNDLE_IDS` in `build_appimage.sh`; keep the two in lockstep.)

## Two build flows, tied together

1. **ROS 2 (multi-distro)** — `data_stream_ros2/docker/run-local.sh --bundle` builds a
   distro-agnostic proxy plus one binary per supported ROS 2 distro
   (`humble`, `iron`, `jazzy`, `rolling`), each compiled in its own Docker image. At load
   time the proxy dispatches to the binary matching the ROS 2 distro installed on the
   user's machine.
2. **App + non-ROS 2 plugins + package** — the default is `appimage/build_in_docker.sh
   --plugins-dir <sdk>/pj_ported_plugins`, which compiles both the app and the aggregate
   plugin set in the Ubuntu 22.04 builder image (glibc 2.35), picks up the ROS 2 bundle
   from step 1, and packages the AppImage. `build_release_appimage.sh` then extracts the
   result, drops any `.so` outside the curated 17 (the aggregate build produces more),
   and repacks — so the released AppImage is portable **and** carries exactly the 17.
   With `--host-build` the same 17-plugin filter runs but the app + plugins are built on
   the host (`./build.sh` and `pj_ported_plugins/build.sh`), producing a faster iteration
   but non-portable AppImage tied to the host's glibc.

```bash
appimage/build_release_appimage.sh                       # DEFAULT: docker (portable, glibc 2.35)
appimage/build_release_appimage.sh --host-build          # opt-in: host build (non-portable)
appimage/build_release_appimage.sh --skip-ros2           # reuse a previous ROS 2 bundle
appimage/build_release_appimage.sh --ros2-distros "jazzy"  # restrict the ROS 2 matrix
appimage/build_release_appimage.sh --fresh               # (docker) wipe the Conan+ccache volumes
```

## Runtime requirement for ROS 2

The `ros2-topic-subscriber` proxy links **no** ROS libraries; it `dlopen`s the per-distro
binary at load time, and that binary links `rclcpp` & friends. So the ROS 2 topic
subscriber only appears (and works) when a supported ROS 2 distribution is installed and
its environment is on the process — i.e. `source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash` before
launching PlotJuggler. With no ROS 2 present the plugin stays silent (this is expected,
not an error); every other bundled plugin works regardless.

## glibc floor / portability

By default `build_release_appimage.sh` runs the app + non-ROS 2 plugin build inside
[`build_in_docker.sh`](./build_in_docker.sh) (Ubuntu 22.04 / glibc 2.35), so the released
AppImage runs on any distro with glibc ≥ 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04 and newer, and equivalents on
other families). ROS 2 inner binaries are always built per-distro in Docker; the proxy
that PlotJuggler loads is built in Ubuntu 22.04, matching the app's glibc floor. Pass
`--host-build` to compile on the host instead — faster for local iteration, but the
resulting AppImage inherits the host's glibc floor (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04 → glibc 2.38).

## Status

`build_release_appimage.sh` is a convenience wrapper over the two flows above, kept for
local/offline embedded builds. The release CI does not use it: it compiles only the app
(inside `ghcr.io/plotjuggler/pj4-appimage-builder`, the thin `ci-base` target of
[`Dockerfile.build`](./Dockerfile.build), published by
`.github/workflows/appimage-builder-image.yml`) and takes every plugin from the
registry.
