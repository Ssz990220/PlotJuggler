/// Leading + trailing rate limiter for a repeatedly-requested action.

/// `request()` runs the action immediately if the throttle window is open
/// (leading edge) and opens a window of `interval_ms`; further `request()`s
/// within the window are coalesced into a single action fired when the window
/// closes (trailing edge). So a burst of N requests collapses to one leading +
/// at most one trailing run, capping the action at ~`1000/interval_ms` Hz no
/// matter how fast requests arrive.
///
/// The action takes no argument — the caller stores the latest payload (e.g. the
/// current tracker time) and the trailing edge runs the action against whatever
/// the caller last stored, which is exactly the "use the newest value, drop the
/// intermediate ones" semantics wanted for a moving playhead.
///
/// This is the single "cap the rate once, at the origin" primitive: put one on
/// the fan-out that every driver (playback ticks, scrubbing, seeks) flows
/// through, rather than throttling each downstream consumer separately.
///
/// Not a QObject and intentionally non-copyable/non-movable (it owns a QTimer):
/// the timer connection captures `this`, and the timer member is destroyed with
/// the trigger, so the connection can never outlive it.
