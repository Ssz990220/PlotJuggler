# Remove a PJ4 feature worktree created by ./worktree-new.sh and delete its
# branch. Refuses if the worktree has uncommitted TRACKED changes (so the
# force-remove below can't eat unpushed source); --force overrides that. The
# remove is always forced at the git level because the worktree carries
# submodules and a gitignored build/ that plain `git worktree remove` won't drop.

Usage: ./worktree-rm.sh <dir> [--keep-branch] [--force]

  <dir>          worktree dir under .worktrees/ (the name worktree-new.sh used)
  --keep-branch  remove the worktree but keep its local branch
  --force        skip the uncommitted-tracked-changes guard
  -h, --help     show this help

Tip: `git worktree list` shows the active worktrees and their dirs.
