# pj_media Architecture

The HOW document for the pj_media module. `REQUIREMENTS.md` defines WHAT
pj_media does; this document defines HOW it is built. Read `REQUIREMENTS.md`
first — this document assumes familiarity with every section.

Cross-references to REQUIREMENTS.md use `§R` notation (e.g., `§R4.3`).
Cross-references to `OBJECT_STORE_DESIGN.md` use `§OS` notation (e.g., `§OS3.4`).

## 1. Module Structure

pj_media ships as two CMake targets with a strict dependency direction:

### pj_media_core (no Qt)

Pure C++ library. Contains everything that does not touch Qt:

| Component | Header(s) | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `MediaSource` | `media_source.h` | Abstract frame-delivery interface: `setTimestamp` + `takeFrame` (§5) |
| `ImagePipelineSource` | `image_pipeline_source.h` | `MediaSource` for images: wraps CodecPipeline + ObjectStore, synchronous decode (§5.1) |
| `FileVideoSource` | `file_video_source.h` | `MediaSource` for file-based video: wraps FfmpegBackend (§5.2) |
| `StreamingVideoSource` | `streaming_video_source.h` | `MediaSource` for streaming video: wraps StreamingVideoDecoder + worker thread (§5.3) |
| `FrameSlot` | `frame_slot.h` | Single-slot latest-wins mailbox (§3) |
| `VideoBackend` | `video_backend.h` | Abstract video playback interface (§4) |
| `FfmpegBackend` | `ffmpeg_backend.h` | FFmpeg-based `VideoBackend`: seek, scrub, play with CancelToken, forward threshold, decodeSkip, thumbnail cache (§4.1) |
| `FfmpegDecoder` | `ffmpeg_decoder.h` | FFmpeg AVCodecContext wrapper: HW-accel probing, outputs YUV420P (§R4.7 compliant) |
| `StreamingVideoDecoder` | `streaming_video_decoder.h` | Decodes H.264 VideoFrame entries from ObjectStore via FfmpegDecoder (§4.4) |
| `ThumbnailCache` | `thumbnail_cache.h` | JPEG-compressed frame cache: background pre-decode at open, auto-scale to 1920px, YUV420P output (§4.1) |
| `H264 NAL utils` | `h264_utils.h` | Annex-B keyframe detection (`isH264Keyframe`), SPS/PPS extraction (`extractH264SpsPps`), codec param builder (`makeH264CodecParams`) |
| `ImageDecoder` | `image_decoder.h` | turbojpeg / libpng / raw-pixel dispatch (§4) |
| `SceneDecoder` | `scene_decoder.h` | CDR / Protobuf deserializer for annotations and 2D primitives (§4) — deferred |
| `MediaIndexRegistry` | `media_index_registry.h` | Per-topic keyframe timestamp index sidechannel (§6) |
| `Compositor` | `compositor.h` | Multi-layer decode orchestration and blending (§8) — deferred |
| `CancelToken` | `cancel_token.h` | Atomic flag polled by decoders between decode units |
| `DecodedFrame` | `decoded_frame.h` | RAII wrapper for decoded pixel data (YUV planes or RGB buffer) |

DataSource plugins do NOT link `pj_media_core` — plugins depend only
on `pj_base` (see `pj_plugins/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Format-specific
helpers (NAL scanning, PTS lookup) belong inside the DataSource plugin
itself or in lightweight headers within `pj_base`.

### pj_media_qt (Qt widgets)

Qt widget library built on top of `pj_media_core`:

| Component | Header(s) | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `MediaViewerWidget` | `media_viewer_widget.h` | `QRhiWidget` subclass: GPU rendering via BT.709 YUV->RGB fragment shader (3 R8 textures for YUV420P), zoom/pan, RGB DecodedFrame path, backward-compatible QImage path. Integrates with `MediaSource` via `setMediaSource()` + `setTimestamp()` (§7) |
| Texture shaders | `shaders/texture.{vert,frag}` | RGBA texture display with view transform matrix |
| YUV shaders | `shaders/yuv_to_rgb.{vert,frag}` | BT.709 YUV420P->RGB conversion via 3 R8 textures |

The Qt layer is thin — it owns the GPU surface and polls the
`MediaSource`'s `takeFrame()` at render rate. All decode logic,
threading, and cancellation live in `pj_media_core`.

---

## 2. Data Flow

Two paths: write (ingest) and read (display). pj_media participates
only in the read path.

### Write path (ingest — pj_media is NOT involved)

```
DataSource plugin
  ├─► [direct]    ObjectStore::pushOwned / pushLazy       ◄── v1
  └─► [delegated] host.pushRawMessage ─► MessageParser::parse()
                                            ├─► scalar write host  (DataEngine)
                                            └─► object write host  (ObjectStore)
                                                                   ◄── requires parser ABI v2
```

**V1 supports direct ingest only.** DataSource plugins call
`pushOwned` / `pushLazy` directly. Delegated ingest (via
`MessageParser::parse()` with two hosts) requires parser ABI v2
(two-host `parse()` signature), which is an outstanding prerequisite
(see `REQUIREMENTS.md` Prerequisites). Delegated ingest is a
subsequent milestone.

### Read path (display — pj_media's domain)

```

     │               │                      │
     │               └─► DecodedFrame (YUV420P or RGB)
     │                        │

     │                        │
     │                   draw quad (BT.709 shader)
     │                        │
     └──────────────────► GPU display
```

On each application tick:

1. The main thread calls `widget->setTimestamp(ts_ns)`, which forwards
   to the attached `MediaSource`. The source either decodes immediately
   (images) or posts a request to its internal worker (video).
2. The main thread triggers a repaint (calls `widget->update()`).
3. In `render()`, the widget calls `source->takeFrame()` to get the
   latest decoded frame. If a new frame is available, it uploads pixel
   data to GPU textures and draws.

The main thread drives both steps — there is no `TimelineCursor`
subscription or callback model. This matches how PlotJuggler's
existing plot widgets are driven.

---

## 3. Scrub Architecture

This section ports the patterns proven in
`~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3` into pj_media's
architecture. That document is the canonical reference for WHY these
patterns work and WHY alternatives fail — read it before modifying
anything in this section.

### 3.1 FrameSlot — the single-slot mailbox

The `FrameSlot` is the mechanism that eliminates stale-frame
interleaving during scrub. It is ~60 lines of code:

```cpp
struct CompositeFrame {
  // Blended pixel buffer from all active layers (RGB or YUV).
  // Exact representation is an implementation detail; may be a
  // shared_ptr to a pixel buffer, an AVFrame, or a QImage.
};

struct SlotResult {
  int64_t timestamp_ns;
  CompositeFrame frame;
};

class FrameSlot {
 public:
  void store(int64_t timestamp_ns, CompositeFrame frame);
  std::optional<SlotResult> take();

 private:
  std::mutex mutex_;
  CompositeFrame frame_;
  int64_t timestamp_ns_ = 0;
  bool has_new_ = false;
};
```

Properties:

- **Latest-wins**: `store()` physically overwrites the previous frame.
  A stale frame cannot reach the display because it is replaced before
  the UI polls.
- **At most two composite frames alive** (one in the slot, one being
  displayed). Memory usage is bounded.
- **No Qt event queue involvement**. No `QMetaCallEvent`, no
  `QueuedConnection`, no `invokeMethod`. The only synchronization
  primitive is `std::mutex`.
- **Pull timing**: the UI polls via `QTimer::timeout` at ~60 Hz. On
  each tick: `auto r = slot_.take(); if (r) uploadToGpu(r->frame);`.

The video_player_lab prototype uses frame indices as identifiers
because it is file-only (§5.1-5.2 of that document). pj_media uses
`int64_t` nanosecond timestamps instead — the universal coordinate
that works for both file and streaming sources.

**Qt signals are NOT used for frame delivery.** Adding a signal escape
hatch is explicitly forbidden. See
`~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2-3.3` for the
structural proof that push-based delivery via Qt event queues cannot be
fixed by patching, and the enumeration of 5+ failed patches that must
not be retried.

### 3.2 Direction-aware cancel-store

When the user scrubs rapidly, in-flight decodes are cancelled via
`CancelToken` (an `atomic<bool>` polled between decode units). The
question is: should a partially-decoded frame be published to the
`FrameSlot`?

The rule, proven in
`~/ws_plotjuggler/video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.6`:

- **Forward scrub** (`current_request_ts > previous_request_ts`):
  publish partials. The decoder is decoding toward the target from a
  keyframe behind it — partial progress shows frames between the
  previous position and the target, which matches the user's drag
  direction.
- **Backward scrub** (`current_request_ts < previous_request_ts`):
  suppress partials. The decoder replays FORWARD from a keyframe
  while the user is dragging BACKWARD — publishing partials would
  show frames moving in the wrong direction.
- **Same position or first request**: suppress.

Implementation: `FfmpegBackend` tracks `last_request_ts_` and sets
a `scrub_backward_` flag on the active decode before each new request.
The decoder checks this flag in its cancel path.
`StreamingVideoSource` uses a simpler latest-wins model (no partials).

### 3.3 CancelToken

Each decode request carries a `CancelToken` — a class wrapping an
`atomic<bool>`, shared between requester and decoder via
`shared_ptr<CancelToken>`:

```cpp
class CancelToken {
 public:
  bool isCancelled() const { return flag_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); }
  void cancel() { flag_.store(true, std::memory_order_relaxed); }

 private:
  std::atomic<bool> flag_{false};
};
```

Decoders poll `token->isCancelled()` at natural check points:

- `VideoDecoder`: between NAL units (after each `avcodec_receive_frame`).
- `ImageDecoder`: between JPEG MCU rows (if turbojpeg supports
  progressive; otherwise after the single decode call).
- `SceneDecoder`: between primitives in a batch message.

A new request flips the previous token. The decoder returns early, and
the decoder (or its owning `MediaSource`) decides whether to publish
the partial result based on the direction-aware rule (§3.2).

---

## 4. Codec Pipeline

> For the upstream wire-format contract (Mosaico-side storage types that
> the codec pipeline decodes), see [`mosaico_media.md`](./mosaico_media.md).

Each ObjectStore topic produces raw bytes in a wire format. To reach
display-ready pixels, those bytes pass through a **codec pipeline** —
an ordered chain of stateless transforms configured per-layer at
widget setup time.

Every link in the chain is a codec. Some decode bytes→bytes (envelope
stripping), some decode bytes→pixels (image decompression), some
transform pixels→pixels (visualization mapping). The pipeline doesn't
distinguish these — they're all codecs applied in sequence.

### Examples

```
ROS2 CompressedImage:    CdrStripper → JpegDecoder → [identity]
ROS2 CompressedDepth:    CdrStripper → DepthPngDecoder → DepthColormap
Foxglove CompressedImage: JsonExtractor → JpegDecoder → [identity]
Raw segmentation mask:   [identity] → PaletteMapper
MP4 video:               VideoBackend (libmpv handles internally)
```

### Design

```cpp
class CodecStage {
 public:
  virtual ~CodecStage() = default;
  virtual Expected<DecodedFrame> decode(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) = 0;
};
```

A `CodecPipeline` is a `vector<unique_ptr<CodecStage>>`. Each stage
consumes raw bytes and either:
- Returns a `DecodedFrame` with `PixelFormat` set → terminal stage,
  pipeline stops.
- Returns a `DecodedFrame` where `pixels` contains intermediate
  bytes → next stage consumes `pixels->data()` and `pixels->size()`.

The last stage must produce display-ready pixels (RGB/RGBA). The
`ImagePipelineSource` receives the pipeline at construction time,
configured based on the topic's `metadata_json` (encoding, schema,
media_class).

### Codec inventory

**Envelope codecs** (bytes → bytes):

| Codec | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `CdrStripper` | CDR-wrapped message | Payload bytes (after header + string fields) |
| `JsonExtractor` | JSON message with base64 `data` field | Raw image bytes |
| `CompressedDepthStripper` | ROS2 compressedDepth | PNG payload (strips 12-byte header) |

**Image codecs** (bytes → pixels):

| Codec | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `JpegDecoder` | JPEG bytes | RGB888 pixels |
| `PngDecoder` | PNG bytes | RGB888 or RGBA8888 or Mono16 pixels |
| `RawDecoder` | Raw pixel buffer + dimensions | Typed DecodedFrame |

**Visualization codecs** (pixels → display pixels):

| Codec | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `DepthColormap` | Mono16 depth values | RGB888 (grayscale, jet, turbo — configurable) |
| `SegmentationPalette` | Mono8 class IDs | RGB888 (color per class) |
| `Identity` | Any RGB/RGBA | Passthrough (no-op) |

These are all built-in classes in `pj_media_core`, not plugins.
Adding a new codec requires a code change — same rule as before.

### 4.1 Video: VideoBackend abstraction

Video playback uses a `VideoBackend` abstract interface defined in
`pj_media_core`. Concrete backends handle file I/O, decoding,
seeking, and HW acceleration internally. The widget layer calls
`open()`, `seek()`, `setPaused()`, and `renderFrame()` without
knowing which backend is active.

**Three video components exist**, serving different use cases:

**`FfmpegBackend`** (primary, file-based): opens MP4/MKV files
directly via `AVFormatContext`. Custom decode pipeline
with full scrub control. Uses `FfmpegDecoder` for decode,
`CancelToken` for cooperative cancellation, and `FrameSlot` for
frame delivery via `processEvents()` (no Qt event queue). Key
features:

- **Forward threshold** (`kForwardThreshold=100`): when the target
  is within 100 frames of the current position, continues decoding
  forward instead of seeking. Avoids costly seek+flush for small
  forward jumps during scrub.
- **decodeSkip optimization**: skips HW transfer + sws_scale for
  intermediate frames during seek-to-target. Only the final target
  frame gets full decode.
- **Direction-aware partial filter**: uses `scrub_backward_` flag
  to suppress partial publications during backward scrub (prevents
  forward jumps). Forward scrub publishes partials normally.
- **Seek throttle**: 33ms (30 Hz) with duplicate elimination.
- **Min decode time**: 60ms minimum before cancellation check,
  preventing thrashing on fast scrub.
- **B-frame PTS fix**: uses `AVFrame::pts` (presentation timestamp)
  instead of packet PTS, which is incorrect for B-frame reordering.
- **Target refinement**: within the same GOP during backward scrub,
  publishes the keyframe immediately for instant feedback, then
  decodes to the exact target and replaces it.
- **ThumbnailCache**: background thread pre-decodes 1 frame/second
  at file open time. Stores as JPEG at quality 85 (~90KB/frame
  1080p, ~133KB/frame 4K->1920). Auto-scales to max 1920px width
  for 4K content. YUV420P throughout (JPEG stores YUV, decompresses
  to YUV, same BT.709 shader). Provides instant backward scrub
  feedback via cached thumbnails before the full-resolution decode
  completes.
- **YUV420P output** (§R4.7 compliant): FfmpegDecoder outputs
  YUV420P planes directly. No CPU-side RGB conversion. The
  MediaViewerWidget renders via BT.709 fragment shader with 3 R8
  textures. 75% GPU memory reduction vs RGBA8.


**`StreamingVideoDecoder`** (streaming / ObjectStore-based): decodes
H.264 VideoFrame entries from ObjectStore. Described in §4.4. Wrapped
by `StreamingVideoSource` (§5.3) for `MediaSource` integration.

**Design note**: `VideoBackend` uses `double seconds` for seek and
position rather than `int64_t` nanoseconds. This matches FFmpeg's
`time_base` conventions. The nanosecond↔seconds conversion happens
at the `FileVideoSource` boundary (§5.2).

### 4.2 Image codecs

`JpegDecoder`, `PngDecoder`, and `RawDecoder` are `CodecStage`
implementations. They are stateless — multiple instances per widget
are fine. `ImageDecoder` (the current class) bundles JPEG + PNG + raw
dispatch as a convenience; internally each is a separate codec stage.

No decoded-frame cache. On-the-fly decode is fast enough for stills
that caching wastes more memory than it saves time (§R4.2).

### 4.3 SceneDecoder

Stateless. One instance per scene/annotation layer. Deserializes CDR
or Protobuf wire format into typed scene primitives and annotations
(see `datatypes_2D.md` for the type catalog).

Output is a `SceneFrame` — a collection of typed primitives ready for
the compositor to rasterize or overlay.

### 4.4 StreamingVideoDecoder

Decodes H.264 VideoFrame entries stored in ObjectStore. Unlike
`FfmpegBackend` (which reads from files via `AVFormatContext`),
`StreamingVideoDecoder` reads encoded NAL units from ObjectStore
entries — the path for streaming sources (ROS 2, RTSP, etc.) that
push VideoFrame messages into ObjectStore at ingest time.

**Not a `VideoBackend` subclass.** `VideoBackend` is file-oriented
(`open(path)`, fixed `duration()`). The streaming case reads from
ObjectStore, has dynamic duration (retention window), and no file path.
`StreamingVideoDecoder` lives in `pj_media_core` with no Qt dependency.

**API:**

```cpp
class StreamingVideoDecoder {
 public:
  void attach(ObjectStore* store, ObjectTopicId topic);
  Expected<DecodedFrame> decodeAt(Timestamp ts);
  void reset();
  bool isInitialized() const;
};
```

**Two-path decode strategy:**

1. **Forward path** (live mode and forward scrub): when the target
   timestamp is at or ahead of the last decoded position, the decoder
   continues forward without flushing. Uses `FfmpegDecoder::decodeSkip()`
   for intermediate frames and `decode()` only for the target.
   This is O(1) per frame in live mode (one decode per call).

2. **Seek path** (backward scrub, cross-GOP jump, first decode): finds
   the nearest keyframe before the target in the keyframe index, flushes
   the decoder, and decodes forward from the keyframe to the target.

**Same-timestamp cache:** When the display polls faster than the push
rate (e.g., 60 Hz display vs 30 Hz push), `decodeAt()` is called with
the same timestamp twice. The cached `last_frame_` is returned
immediately — no re-decode, no seek.

**Keyframe index:** Built incrementally by NAL-inspecting each new
entry via `isH264Keyframe()` (scans for IDR NAL type 5 in annex-B
start codes). Tracked by `last_scanned_ts_` to handle the steady-state
case where retention keeps `entryCount()` constant while entries
are replaced. Evicted keyframe timestamps are pruned against
`timeRange().first` on each update.

**Decoder initialization:** Deferred until the first keyframe arrives
(join-mid-stream support). `makeH264CodecParams()` extracts SPS/PPS
from the keyframe's annex-B data and sets it as `AVCodecParameters::extradata`,
enabling proper VAAPI/CUDA surface pool initialization.

**Eviction resilience:** In live mode, the original keyframe may be
evicted by retention while the decoder continues forward. The forward
path does not require the keyframe — the decoder already has the
correct codec state from previous sequential decodes. Only backward
seeks require a keyframe still present in the store.

### 4.5 Video Pipeline Summary

Which component to use depends on the data source:

| Scenario | Component | ObjectStore? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| File-based MP4/MKV playback | FfmpegBackend | No | Direct file access via AVFormatContext. Best scrub performance. |
| Streaming VideoFrame (ROS 2, RTSP) | StreamingVideoDecoder | Yes | Encoded packets in ObjectStore with retention budget. |
| File-based MCAP with CompressedVideo | StreamingVideoDecoder | Yes (lazy) | DataSource pushes encoded packets at open time. |
| ML datasets (LeRobot, RLDS) | FfmpegBackend | No | MP4 per camera; Parquet scalars go to DataEngine. Episodes map to DatasetId. |

**File-based video does not go through ObjectStore** — the file itself is
the random-access store. ObjectStore adds value only for streaming, where
it provides the retention buffer. The application constructs the right
`MediaSource` implementation (§5) based on the topic's `media_class`
metadata.

**Multi-modal datasets** (video + scalars from the same recording): the
DataSource plugin populates both stores — `DataEngine` for plottable
time-series and `ObjectStore` for media. Both share the same timestamp
domain and are driven by the same global timeline cursor. Episodes in ML
datasets (e.g., LeRobot episodes) map to PlotJuggler's `DatasetId` —
each episode is a separate dataset with its own time range.

---

## 5. MediaSource

The uniform frame-delivery interface between decoder backends and
`MediaViewerWidget`.

```cpp
class MediaSource {
 public:
  virtual ~MediaSource() = default;
  virtual void setTimestamp(int64_t ts_ns) = 0;
  virtual std::optional<DecodedFrame> takeFrame() = 0;
};
```

**Design rationale**: `PlaybackController` was a monolithic orchestrator
that would have owned decoders, worker threads, FrameSlot, compositor,
and CancelToken management. This conflicted with `FfmpegBackend`, which
is already a self-contained subsystem (owns its thread, seek throttle,
thumbnail cache, cancellation). `MediaSource` is a thin adapter that
lets each decoder path manage its own complexity at the right granularity.

**Contract**:

- `setTimestamp(ts_ns)` is called by the main thread when the global
  time changes. May decode synchronously or post to an internal worker.
- `takeFrame()` is called by the main thread at render rate. Returns
  the latest decoded frame, or nullopt if nothing new since last call.
- No `cancel()` in the public interface — each implementation manages
  cancellation internally when a new `setTimestamp` arrives.
- The widget calls `update()` after `setTimestamp()` to trigger repaint.

### 5.1 ImagePipelineSource

Wraps `CodecPipeline` + `ObjectStore`. Decodes synchronously in
`setTimestamp()` — JPEG at 1080p is <10ms, adequate for 30fps scrub.

```cpp
class ImagePipelineSource : public MediaSource {
 public:
  ImagePipelineSource(ObjectStore* store, ObjectTopicId topic,
                      std::unique_ptr<CodecPipeline> pipeline);
  void setTimestamp(int64_t ts_ns) override;
  std::optional<DecodedFrame> takeFrame() override;
};
```

Internals: `setTimestamp` calls `store->latestAt(topic, ts)` →
`pipeline->decode(data, size)` → stores result in an internal buffer.
`takeFrame` returns the buffer and clears it (nullopt on second call).

No worker thread, no CancelToken, no FrameSlot. The simplest
implementation.

### 5.2 FileVideoSource

Wraps `FfmpegBackend`. The backend stays self-contained — it owns its
decode thread, seek throttle, ThumbnailCache, direction-aware partials,
and CancelToken management. `FileVideoSource` is a thin adapter.

```cpp
class FileVideoSource : public MediaSource {
 public:
  static Expected<std::unique_ptr<FileVideoSource>> open(const std::string& path);

  void setTimestamp(int64_t ts_ns) override;
  std::optional<DecodedFrame> takeFrame() override;

  // Additional API beyond MediaSource (for slider/transport UI):
  double duration() const;
  double position() const;
  void setPaused(bool paused);
  bool isPaused() const;
  void stepForward();
  void stepBackward();
  void setPositionCallback(VideoBackend::PositionCallback cb);
  void setDurationCallback(VideoBackend::DurationCallback cb);
  void setFileLoadedCallback(VideoBackend::FileLoadedCallback cb);
};
```

Internals: `setTimestamp` converts nanoseconds to seconds and calls
`backend_.seek(seconds)`. `takeFrame` calls `backend_.processEvents()`
(which fires the internal frame callback, storing the latest frame
under a mutex) and returns the stored frame.

The nanosecond↔seconds conversion happens at this boundary. All
internal pj_media timestamps are nanoseconds; `FfmpegBackend` uses
seconds (matching libmpv and FFmpeg `time_base` conventions).

### 5.3 StreamingVideoSource

Wraps `StreamingVideoDecoder` + owns a worker thread + FrameSlot.
`StreamingVideoDecoder::decodeAt()` is synchronous and can be expensive
(seek + decode forward from keyframe), so it runs on a dedicated worker.

```cpp
class StreamingVideoSource : public MediaSource {
 public:
  StreamingVideoSource(ObjectStore* store, ObjectTopicId topic);
  ~StreamingVideoSource();

  void setTimestamp(int64_t ts_ns) override;
  std::optional<DecodedFrame> takeFrame() override;
  bool isInitialized() const;
};
```

Internals:
- `setTimestamp` posts a request to the worker thread (protected by
  mutex + condition variable). If a previous decode is in flight, it
  is not explicitly cancelled — `StreamingVideoDecoder::decodeAt()` is
  synchronous, so the worker finishes the current decode and immediately
  picks up the latest request (latest-wins).
- The worker calls `decoder_.decodeAt(ts)` and stores the result in
  an internal `FrameSlot`.
- `takeFrame` polls the `FrameSlot` and returns the latest frame.

### 5.4 Multi-layer (future)

When compositing is needed, a `CompositeMediaSource` can own multiple
`MediaSource` instances, call `takeFrame()` on each, composite on CPU,
and present the blended result. Same interface, same widget code. This
is deferred until annotation test data is available.

## 6. MediaIndexRegistry

Keyframe tracking lives in pj_media, not in ObjectStore (§R4.2,
§R4.4). The `MediaIndexRegistry` is the sidechannel that holds
per-topic keyframe timestamp lists.

```cpp
class MediaIndexRegistry {
 public:
  void registerIndex(ObjectTopicId topic,
                     std::vector<int64_t> keyframe_timestamps);

  void appendKeyframe(ObjectTopicId topic, int64_t timestamp);

  std::optional<int64_t> keyframeBefore(ObjectTopicId topic,
                                         int64_t timestamp) const;

  void removeIndex(ObjectTopicId topic);
};
```

**Keying**: entries are keyed by `ObjectTopicId`, not topic name
strings — consistent with the rest of the system.

**Lifecycle**: entries are cleared when the corresponding topic is
removed from ObjectStore (`removeTopic`, `clear`). The application
is responsible for calling `removeIndex()` as part of topic teardown.
Widgets observing a removed topic will find no keyframe index and
fall back to sequential decode (no seeking).

### Two population modes

**File-backed sources**: the DataSource plugin pre-computes the
keyframe list at open time — by scanning NAL start codes (H.264/H.265),
reading the MP4 `stss` (sync sample) atom, or equivalent. It publishes
the sorted timestamp array via the C ABI slot
`object_write_host.publish_keyframe_index(topic, timestamps, count)`.
The host receives the array and calls `registerIndex()` on the
application-owned `MediaIndexRegistry`. The DataSource plugin never
links `pj_media_core` — communication is through the C ABI write host
only. This is a one-time cost at file open, amortized over all
subsequent seeks.

**Streaming sources**: the decoder builds the index incrementally.
On each new entry it NAL-parses the first few bytes to detect IDR
frames. `StreamingVideoDecoder` (§4.4) manages its own inline keyframe
timestamp vector rather than using `MediaIndexRegistry` — this is
simpler for the single-consumer case and avoids cross-component
coupling. The per-entry cost is negligible: `isH264Keyframe()` scans
for a 4-byte start code + 1-byte NAL type header, touching at most
the first ~20 bytes of each entry regardless of frame size.

### Usage by VideoDecoder

When `VideoDecoder` needs to seek to timestamp `T` (using the
`ObjectTopicId` it was constructed with):

1. `registry.keyframeBefore(topic_id, T)` → returns `kf_ts`.
2. `ObjectStore::indexAt(topic_id, kf_ts)` → gets the keyframe's index
   `i` in the entry sequence.
3. `ObjectStore::at(topic, i)` → gets the keyframe bytes. Decode it
   after calling `avcodec_flush_buffers` to reset decoder state.
4. Iterate `ObjectStore::at(topic, i+1)`, `at(topic, i+2)`, ...
   decoding each subsequent frame (using `decodeSkip` for intermediates)
   until reaching the entry at timestamp `T`.

Because live and scrub modes are mutually exclusive (§R4.3), the buffer
is frozen during this seek — no entry can be evicted between steps 2
and 4.

### Thread safety

`MediaIndexRegistry` is protected by its own `shared_mutex`.
`registerIndex` and `appendKeyframe` take exclusive locks;
`keyframeBefore` takes a shared lock. The registry is independent of
`ObjectStore`'s locking.

---

## 7. Rendering Pipeline

### 7.1 QRhiWidget

`MediaViewerWidget` subclasses `QRhiWidget` (Qt 6.8+), which abstracts
over Vulkan, Metal, D3D11, and OpenGL at runtime. The widget:

1. Creates 3 R8 GPU textures for YUV420P planes: Y (full resolution),
   U (half resolution), V (half resolution). This is 75% less GPU
   memory than a single RGBA8 texture.
2. On each render tick, polls `FrameSlot::take()`.
3. If a new frame arrived: uploads plane data to GPU textures via
   `QRhiResourceUpdateBatch`.
4. Draws a full-screen quad with the BT.709 YUV-to-RGB fragment shader.
5. A backward-compatible QImage (RGB) path is kept for image viewers
   that produce RGB output directly.

### 7.2 YUV-to-RGB shaders

Fragment shader performs BT.709 color conversion using 3 R8 texture
samplers:

```glsl
vec3 yuv = vec3(
    texture(y_plane, uv).r,
    texture(u_plane, uv).r - 0.5,
    texture(v_plane, uv).r - 0.5
);
fragColor = vec4(bt709_matrix * yuv, 1.0);
```

BT.709 is used for all content. Both live-decoded frames and cached
thumbnails pass through the same shader, eliminating color mismatches
between the two paths.

### 7.3 Zoom and pan

A 3x3 view transform matrix in the vertex shader handles zoom
(mouse-wheel, cursor-anchored) and pan (mouse drag):

```glsl
gl_Position = vec4(view_matrix * vec3(in_position, 1.0), 1.0);
```

The transform is updated on mouse events and stored as widget state.
No pixel reprocessing — transformation is free on the GPU.

### 7.4 Software fallback

When `QRhi` reports no suitable GPU backend, or when the platform
lacks GPU support:

1. Decoder falls back to software decode (guaranteed by
   `VideoDecoder`'s fallback logic).
2. CPU-side YUV→RGB conversion via sws_scale or manual matrix
   multiply.
3. Upload RGB pixels to a `QImage` and render via `QPainter`.

Acceptable degradation; the UX remains functional.

---

## 8. Multi-Layer Compositor

A viewer widget may composite multiple ObjectStore topics at the same
display time (§R4.8). The `Compositor` class orchestrates this.

### 8.1 Layer model

Each layer is a `(topic, decoder, blend_mode, z_order)` tuple
configured at widget construction time. Layer types:

| Layer type | Decoder | Output |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Base image/video | `VideoDecoder` or `ImageDecoder` | RGB/YUV pixel buffer |
| Annotation overlay | `SceneDecoder` | List of 2D primitives (rasterized onto the base) |
| Depth colormap | `ImageDecoder` (mono16) | False-color pixel buffer (colormap applied by compositor) |
| Segmentation mask | `ImageDecoder` | Indexed-color pixel buffer (alpha-blended) |

### 8.2 Compositing pipeline

When compositing is implemented, a `CompositeMediaSource` (§5.4) would
own one `MediaSource` per layer. On each tick:

1. Calls `takeFrame()` on each layer's `MediaSource`.
2. Collects decoded outputs.
3. Applies layer ordering and blending:
   - Base layer rendered first.
   - Overlays rasterized on top (annotations as vector primitives,
     depth/segmentation as alpha-blended pixel buffers).
4. Returns the composited frame via its own `takeFrame()`.

### 8.3 At-or-before semantics

Every layer query uses `latestAt` — strict at-or-before, never a
future entry (§R4.8). A 10 Hz detection overlay composited on a
60 Hz video is correct: the same bounding box persists across
multiple video frames until replaced by a newer annotation.

No automatic skew rejection. Multi-rate is the norm — the compositor
trusts that an entry exists in the store until explicitly evicted.

### 8.4 frame_id correlation (optional)

When an overlay's metadata carries a `frame_id` matching a specific
source image, the compositor may prefer exact pairing over
timestamp-based pairing. Layers without `frame_id` fall back to
timestamp matching.

---

## 9. Clock Integration

### 9.1 Main-thread-driven timestamps

There is no `TimelineCursor` subscription or callback model. The
application's main thread drives timestamps directly:

```cpp
// Application main loop / timer tick:
widget->setTimestamp(current_time_ns);  // forwards to MediaSource
widget->update();                       // triggers repaint
```

This matches how PlotJuggler's existing plot widgets are driven — the
main thread iterates over widgets and tells each one to update. Media
widgets are passive; they never drive the clock.

### 9.2 Rate hints

DataSource plugins publish optional hints at startup:

- `preferred_fps`: natural frame rate of the source (e.g., 30.0 for
  a 30 fps video).
- `natural_range_ns`: total duration of the dataset.

The application's clock aggregates hints across sources and picks a
default playback pace. The user may override.

### 9.3 Live vs scrub mode

The application manages the live/scrub mode transition (§R4.3).
From pj_media's perspective:

- **Live mode**: the main thread calls
  `widget->setTimestamp(timeRange().second)` on each tick.
  Each `ObjectStore::latestAt` returns the most recent entry.

- **Scrub mode**: the main thread calls
  `widget->setTimestamp(slider_value_ns)` driven by user interaction.
  The buffer is frozen — no pushes, no eviction.

The `MediaSource` does not know or care which mode is active. It
reacts identically: receive timestamp → decode → deliver frame. The
mode distinction is entirely in whether the timestamp advances
automatically or manually, and whether the DataSource is actively
pushing.

---

## 10. Threading Model

### 10.1 Thread roles

| Thread | Responsibilities | Lock discipline |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Qt main thread** | UI events, `widget->setTimestamp()`, `widget->render()` → `source->takeFrame()`, GPU upload | Never blocks on decode (except `ImagePipelineSource` which decodes synchronously in `setTimestamp`, <10ms). For `FileVideoSource`, `takeFrame()` calls `processEvents()` which is main-thread safe |
| **FfmpegBackend decode thread** (1 per `FileVideoSource`) | Seek, decode, direction-aware partials, ThumbnailCache | Internal to FfmpegBackend. Publishes frames via `pending_frame_` under `pending_mutex_`. Main thread reads via `processEvents()` |
| **StreamingVideoSource worker** (1 per `StreamingVideoSource`) | `StreamingVideoDecoder::decodeAt()`, `FrameSlot::store()` | Acquires ObjectStore shared locks (released immediately after handle copy). Holds decoder-internal state exclusively |
| **DataSource poll thread** (1 per app, existing) | `DataSource::poll()` → `ObjectStore::pushOwned/pushLazy` | Acquires ObjectStore exclusive locks per push. Never touches decoders |

### 10.2 Lock inventory

| Lock | Type | Protects | Held by |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| `ObjectSeries::mutex` (§OS3.4) | `shared_mutex` | Per-topic entry storage | Shared: worker threads via `latestAt`/`at`/`indexAt`. Exclusive: poll thread via `pushOwned`/`pushLazy`/eviction |
| `FrameSlot::mutex_` | `mutex` | Single-frame mailbox | Worker: `store()`. Main: `take()`. Never held concurrently — always < 1 us |
| `MediaIndexRegistry::mutex_` | `shared_mutex` | Keyframe index | Shared: worker via `keyframeBefore`. Exclusive: DataSource via `registerIndex`, worker via `appendKeyframe` |

### 10.3 Lock ordering

No nested locking across the three lock families. Each lock is
acquired and released independently — never held simultaneously:

1. Worker acquires `ObjectSeries::mutex` (shared) → copies
   `shared_ptr` handle → releases lock.
2. Worker decodes (no locks held — decoder operates on owned data).
   For streaming video, if the decoder detects a keyframe via NAL
   inspection, it calls `MediaIndexRegistry::appendKeyframe()` which
   acquires `MediaIndexRegistry::mutex_` (exclusive) → appends →
   releases. This happens after the ObjectStore lock is released.
3. Worker acquires `FrameSlot::mutex_` → stores frame → releases.

The main thread acquires `FrameSlot::mutex_` (via `take()`) for
`StreamingVideoSource`. For `ImagePipelineSource`, the main thread
acquires `ObjectSeries::mutex` (shared, via `latestAt()`) directly
in `setTimestamp()` — this is brief (<1us) and acceptable.
For `FileVideoSource`, the main thread calls `processEvents()` which
swaps pending state under `pending_mutex_` — also brief.

### 10.4 Contention analysis

- **ObjectStore shared_mutex**: at typical media frame rates (30-60
  fps), the push thread holds an exclusive lock for ~1 us per entry
  (deque append + timestamp vector append + optional eviction).
  Worker threads hold shared locks for ~1 us per query (binary search
  + shared_ptr copy). Contention is effectively zero.
- **FrameSlot mutex**: held for < 1 us on both sides (store is a
  move; take is a move). Zero contention in practice.
- **MediaIndexRegistry shared_mutex**: reads (binary search) are
  O(log k) where k is the number of keyframes. Writes
  (`appendKeyframe`) are O(1) amortized. Negligible contention.

### 10.5 Error propagation across threads

Errors from decoder workers must not propagate as C++ exceptions
across the worker→UI thread boundary (§R5). The error flow:

1. **Worker thread**: decoder methods return `PJ::Expected<DecodedFrame>`
   or similar. If a decoder fails (corrupt data, unsupported codec,
   HW-accel error), the worker catches the failure at the thread
   boundary.
2. **Last-error state**: the `MediaSource` implementation stores the
   error internally. `takeFrame()` returns `nullopt` on error — the
   widget continues displaying the last good frame.
3. **UI thread**: on its next poll, the widget checks the last-error
   state. If set, it renders a visible error indicator (e.g., "decode
   failed" overlay or a no-signal background) on the affected layer.
4. **Recovery**: the error state is cleared when the next successful
   decode completes.

**Missing data is not an error**: when `ObjectStore::latestAt` returns
`nullopt` on a valid topic (e.g., the cursor is before the first
entry), the widget renders a "no data" indicator without raising,
logging, or surfacing an error condition.

### 10.6 EntryTimestampsView and extended locks

`ObjectStore::entryTimestamps()` returns an `EntryTimestampsView` that
holds a `shared_lock` for its lifetime (§OS4). pj_media's
`VideoDecoder` may use it during seek planning (batch timestamp
access). The lock is shared (readers-only), so it does not block other
decoders, but it blocks the push thread for the view's lifetime.

Rule: any code path that acquires an `EntryTimestampsView` must drop
it promptly — copy timestamps into a local vector if further
processing is needed beyond the search. Never hold a view across a
decode call.

## 11. Port Map

What to take from each reference prototype and what to leave behind.

### From `video_player_lab/`

| Component | Action | Target in pj_media | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| `FrameSlot` | **PORT** | `pj_media_core/frame_slot.h` | Copy the ~60-line implementation. Change identity from `size_t index` to `int64_t timestamp_ns`. The mechanism is identical |
| Direction-aware cancel-store | **PORTED** | `FfmpegBackend` | Direction tracking lives inside FfmpegBackend's decode thread. StreamingVideoSource uses latest-wins request model instead |
| `VideoDecoder::flush()` at EOF | **PORT** | `VideoDecoder` | 3 lines: send NULL packet, drain buffered frames. Currently missing in the parallel pj_media effort |
| `ENOMEM` recovery | **PORT** | `VideoDecoder` | On `AVERROR(ENOMEM)`: `avcodec_flush_buffers` + retry once. Hit during scrub testing |
| `FrameCache` (JPEG cache) | **PORTED** as `ThumbnailCache` | `pj_media_core/thumbnail_cache.h` | Background thread pre-decodes 1 frame/sec at open. JPEG quality 85, auto-scale to 1920px for 4K. YUV420P throughout. Used by FfmpegBackend for instant backward scrub |
| `FrameConverter` | **DO NOT PORT** | — | Equivalent HW→SW transfer exists in pj_media's `VideoDecoder` |
| `Mp4DataSource` | **DO NOT PORT** | — | pj_media handles MP4 via `FFmpegVideoSource`. The prototype's demuxer is narrower |
| `PlaybackClock` | **DO NOT PORT** | — | Replaced by main-thread-driven `setTimestamp()` model |
| `VideoWidget` (QRhiWidget) | **DO NOT PORT** | — | pj_media already has `MediaViewerWidget` with the same QRhi + shader approach plus additional features (pixel inspector) |
| Keyframe pre-decode at open | **PORTED** as `ThumbnailCache` | `pj_media_core/thumbnail_cache.h` | Implemented: background thread pre-decodes 1 frame/sec at open time, used for instant backward scrub feedback |

### From `~/ws_plotjuggler/pj_media/` (parallel effort)

| Component | Action | Target in pj_media | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| QRhiWidget + YUV shaders | **CHERRY-PICK** | `MediaViewerWidget` | The shader code and QRhi setup are production-ready. Adapt to pj_media_core's frame types |
| FFmpegVideoSource / VideoDecoder | **CHERRY-PICK** | `VideoDecoder` | HW-accel probing, codec open/close, sws_scale paths. Strip the push-based delivery and replace with FrameSlot |
| `FrameSlot` (already ported from video_player_lab) | **USE AS-IS** | — | Already present in the parallel effort |
| ImageSource + BufferStrategy | **ADAPT** | `ImageDecoder` | The per-topic buffer strategy is more complex than needed for pj_media_core's stateless `ImageDecoder`. Take the turbojpeg/libpng dispatch; leave the caching strategy |
| PayloadDescriptor bytecode VM | **EVALUATE** | — | Clever but complex. Evaluate whether the simpler approach (metadata_json + decoder dispatch) suffices before porting |
| TimelineBridge | **DO NOT PORT** | — | Replaced by main-thread-driven `setTimestamp()` model |
| Timestamp µs vs ns dichotomy | **FIX** | — | pj_media uses ns everywhere. The parallel effort's video engine used µs internally. All internal timestamps must be int64_t nanoseconds |

### From `plotjuggler_core/pj_media/mcap_player/`

| Component | Action | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `LazyMediaSeries<T>` callback model | **VALIDATED** | The pattern (timestamps + resolve closures capturing shared_ptr) is sound and maps directly to ObjectStore's `pushLazy` with fetch callbacks. The mcap_player sandbox validated the approach. No code to port — ObjectStore implements the pattern natively |
| `CompressedImageParser` (CDR → turbojpeg) | **REFERENCE** | Demonstrates the parser → decoder split. In pj_media proper, the CDR envelope peeling is a `MessageParser` plugin; the turbojpeg decode is `ImageDecoder` |

## Appendix: Key Invariants

These invariants are load-bearing. Violating any of them reintroduces
bugs that were already proven unfixable by patching.

1. **No Qt signals for frame delivery.** The `MediaSource::takeFrame()`
   pull model is the only path from decoder to display. Adding a signal
   escape hatch reintroduces stale-frame interleaving. (Proof:
   `video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2-3.3`)

2. **One MediaSource per widget.** The widget polls exactly one source
   for frames. When multi-layer compositing is added, a
   `CompositeMediaSource` composites internally and presents a single
   frame via the same interface.

3. **Backward scrub suppresses partial publications.** Forward partials
   are fine; backward partials show frames moving in the wrong
   direction. (Proof: `video_player_lab/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.6`)

4. **ObjectStore handles are owning.** A decoder can hold a byte handle
   while the store pushes and evicts. No use-after-free is possible.
   (Guarantee: §OS3.4, §OS4)

5. **Live and scrub are mutually exclusive.** During scrub, the buffer
   is frozen — no pushes, no eviction. Seek sequences (keyframe →
   decode forward) cannot race with eviction. (Requirement: §R4.3)

6. **Keyframe tracking is pj_media's concern, not ObjectStore's.**
   ObjectStore is codec-agnostic (§OS3.6). `MediaIndexRegistry` owns
   keyframe indices. (Decision: §R4.2, §R4.4)

7. **Parsers are codec-agnostic envelope peelers.** They never inspect
   NAL types, keyframe flags, or GOP structure. All codec knowledge
   lives in pj_media's decoder classes. (Decision: §R4.4)
