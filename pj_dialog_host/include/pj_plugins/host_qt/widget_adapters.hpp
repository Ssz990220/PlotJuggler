// for PlotJuggler's own styled equivalents, while keeping the ORIGINAL control
// hidden and alive so plugin data/events keep flowing through it unchanged.
//
//   QRadioButton (exclusive pair) -> DualOptionsWidget (segmented control)
//   QCheckBox                     -> ToggleSwitch (inline label on the left)

// The originals stay in the widget tree (hidden) and remain the source of truth
// for plugin WidgetData and the event callbacks wired by connectWidgetSignals;
// the styled replacements just drive them. Adaptation is structural (depends on
// the widget tree, built once at load), so the engines call adaptStyledWidgets
// once after loading the .ui; widget_binding then keeps the replacements in sync
// per applied widget via the seam below.

/// Adapt every adaptable control under `root` (radios, checkboxes, comboboxes).
/// Call once after the .ui is loaded. Idempotent and safe to re-run.

/// while leaving the table's edges to the surrounding chrome (header, splitter
