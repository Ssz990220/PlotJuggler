/// calls `onTopicCommitted()`) refreshes it on the SAME signal that already moves
/// the raw ghost. No panel-side `samplesIngested` connection and no throttle timer
/// are needed — the filtered curve tracks streaming data because it rides the
/// ghost's refresh path. The pull/lazy model also means the recompute happens once
/// per paint, coalescing bursts of commits for free.
///
/// The filter is rebuilt FRESH on every recompute via `factory_` (processors are
/// stateful, so a preview must not reuse an accumulator across recomputes) and run
/// over the WHOLE input column (matching Apply and the previous preview). x is in
/// display seconds via the same `SessionManager::displayOffset` seam the ghost uses,
