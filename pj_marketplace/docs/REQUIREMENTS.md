# PlotJuggler Marketplace — Requirements

> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Last Updated:** 2026-05-19
> **Purpose:** Define WHAT the application should do, not HOW

---

## 1. Problem Statement

PlotJuggler has grown significantly, evolving from an internal tool to a de facto standard for data visualization in robotics. With this growth comes a problem: **how do we allow the community to contribute plugins without requiring a full PlotJuggler recompilation for each update?**

### Current Pain Points

1. Users must recompile plugins when PlotJuggler updates
2. Qt version mismatches break plugins silently
3. High barrier to entry for plugin developers (CMake, Conan, CI setup)
4. No central discovery mechanism for available plugins
5. Manual installation process is error-prone

## 2. Feature Overview

### 2.1 Client Features (Marketplace UI)

| Category           | Feature              | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discovery**      | Extension listing    | Display all available extensions in VSCode-style cards        |
|                    | Search               | Search by name, description, tags, and publisher              |
|                    | Category filtering   | Data Loader, Data Streamer, Parser, Toolbox                   |
|                    | Extension detail     | Panel with complete information, changelog, and dependencies  |
|                    | Startup snapshot     | Host app may seed the marketplace with already-loaded plugin ids/versions before first render |
| **Installation**   | Secure download      | ZIP artifact download with SHA256 verification                |
|                    | Automatic extraction | Decompression to extensions directory                         |
|                    | Platform detection   | Automatic selection of correct artifact (Linux/Windows/macOS) |
| **Updates**        | Update detection     | Local vs registry version comparison (semver); local-newer state is surfaced explicitly |
|                    | Individual update    | Update a specific extension                                   |
|                    | Bulk update          | "Update All" for multiple extensions                          |
|                    | Automatic backup     | Backup of previous version before updating                    |
| **Uninstallation** | Clean removal        | Directory deletion + installed cache refresh                  |

|                    | Persistent state     | Installed state derived from plugin DSOs; each embedded plugin manifest is the source of truth |
|                    | Registry URL settings | Configure registry URL at runtime via ⚙ settings dialog; rejects URLs with non-http(s)/file scheme; change triggers immediate refresh |
|                    | Registry URL persistence | Last configured registry URL saved and restored between sessions |
|                    | Unified diagnostics  | All lifecycle events (install / staged-promotion / quarantine / uninstall failures, registry-fetch errors) are surfaced through `ExtensionManager::diagnosticReported`, the in-memory ring buffer, AND an optional `PJ::DiagnosticSink` so embedding hosts can fold marketplace events into their own diagnostic stream |
| **UI/UX**          | Download progress    | Progress bar in status bar                                    |
|                    | Notifications        | Status messages and available update alerts                   |

---

## 3. Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Extension** | Marketplace distribution unit. Downloadable ZIP containing one or more plugins. |
| **Plugin** | C++ module dynamically loaded (.so/.dll/.dylib) implementing an SDK interface. |
| **Registry** | Static JSON file with the catalog of available extensions. |
| **Plugin SDK** | Abstract library (no Qt) that plugins use for UI and data access. |
| **Artifact** | Compiled binary of an extension for a specific platform. |
| **Embedded manifest** | JSON string exported by each plugin DSO describing the installed plugin. |

---

## 3a. Out of scope

These concerns are intentionally **not** part of `pj_marketplace` and belong
elsewhere in the host application:

- **Enable/disable installed plugins.** Toggling a plugin on or off without
  uninstalling it is a host-application concern (e.g. a per-user config knob
  in `pj_app` that filters which discovered DSOs the loader instantiates),
  not a marketplace concern. The marketplace's job ends at "installed on
  disk"; whether the host chooses to load that DSO at startup is decided by
  the host's plugin loader and config.
- **Runtime hot-reload of plugin instances.** Out of scope per PJ4_PLAN
  non-goals.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 P0 — Minimum Viable Product

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| F-01 | Fetch and parse registry JSON from configurable URL | Given a valid URL, the system loads and parses extension metadata |
| F-02 | List extensions in sidebar with cards | User sees all available extensions with name, description, version |
| F-03 | Search by name, description, tags | Typing "ros" shows all ROS-related extensions |
| F-04 | Filter by category | User can filter by Data Loader, Streamer, Parser, Toolbox |
| F-05 | Show selected extension detail | Clicking an extension shows full information panel |
| F-06 | Download ZIP with SHA256 verification | Download fails if checksum doesn't match |
| F-07 | Extract ZIP to extensions directory | ZIP contents are extracted to correct location |
| F-08 | Register installed extension | Installed state is derived from disk by scanning extension DSOs and reading each embedded plugin manifest |
| F-09 | Detect updates (local vs registry version) | User sees "Update available" badge when registry is newer, and "Local newer" when the installed version is ahead |
| F-10 | Uninstall extension | User can remove installed extensions |

### 4.2 P1 — Robustness

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| F-24 | Configure registry URL via settings dialog | User can open ⚙ settings, enter a custom URL, and the marketplace immediately fetches from the new URL |
| F-25 | Persist registry URL between sessions | The last configured registry URL is saved and automatically restored on next launch |
| F-11 | Local registry cache with TTL *(deferred)* | Not implemented today — `RegistryManager` always fetches fresh. Would be reintroduced only if a clear caching need emerges (see [TODO.md](TODO.md)). |
| F-12 | Backup previous version on updates | Old version saved before overwriting |
| F-13 | Automatic rollback if plugin fails | Deferred; backups may exist, but automatic restore is not implemented |
| F-14 | Windows staging: apply on restart | Updates downloaded but applied only after restart (Windows) |
| F-16 | Cancel download in progress | User can abort a download |
| F-17 | Update All | Single action to update all extensions with available updates |
| F-18 | Confirmation dialogs | User confirms before install/uninstall/update actions |

### 4.3 P2 — Polish

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| F-19 | Extension icons (download + cache) | Each extension displays its icon |
| F-20 | Changelog per extension | User can see version history |
| F-21 | Metrics (downloads, rating) | Extension cards show popularity metrics |
| F-22 | Notification: "N updates available" | User notified of available updates |
| F-23 | Multiple registry URLs | Support for private/enterprise registries |

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

---

## 8. Corner Cases and Edge Cases

### 8.1 Network Issues

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| No internet connection | Show cached registry (if available), disable install/update |
| Registry URL unreachable | Show error message, offer retry |
| Download interrupted | Partial file deleted, user can retry |
| Checksum mismatch | Download rejected, user notified |

### 8.2 File System Issues

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Insufficient disk space | Error before extraction, suggest cleanup |
| No write permission to extensions dir | Clear error message, suggest running with permissions |
| Extension directory doesn't exist | Create it automatically |
| Corrupted ZIP file | Extraction fails gracefully, user notified |

### 8.3 Version Conflicts

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Extension requires newer PlotJuggler | Show warning, prevent install |
| Downgrade requested | Reject with a diagnostic; keep the local install unchanged |
| Same version reinstall | Ask confirmation, then reinstall |

### 8.4 Windows-Specific

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Plugin DLL in use (can't overwrite) | Stage update, apply on restart |
| Invalid staged update | Remove staged files and leave active install untouched |
| PlotJuggler crashes before applying update | Pending update remains for next start |

### 8.5 Plugin Loading

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Plugin crashes on load | Report load failure; automatic rollback is deferred |
| Plugin incompatible with current SDK | Clear error message, don't load |
| Embedded manifest missing or invalid | Reject install or staged promotion with diagnostics |
| Marketplace opens in a host app | Seed the initial UI from the host's loaded-plugin snapshot, then reconcile with disk refreshes on demand |

---

## 9. Constraints

### 9.1 Must NOT Do

- **No backend server** — All hosting via GitHub (serverless)
- **No Qt dependency in plugins** — Plugins use abstract SDK only
- **No database** — Registry data is JSON; installed state is discovered from embedded DSO manifests, not a local state database
- **No user accounts** — Anonymous usage
- **No telemetry** — No data collection without consent

### 9.2 Assumptions

- Users have internet access for initial install
- GitHub raw URLs remain accessible
- Extensions are < 50MB compressed
- Registry has < 100 extensions in foreseeable future
- **Plugin ABI surface stays narrow.** Plugins do not link Qt — they
  consume the C ABI declared in `plotjuggler_sdk/pj_plugins` and
  expose only a small embedded manifest plus their vtable. This keeps
  cross-platform CI simple and decouples plugin builds from Qt
  version churn.

### 9.3 Out of Scope (v1.0)

- Paid extensions / license management
- Dependency resolution between extensions
- Automatic updates (always user-initiated)
- Plugin sandboxing / security isolation
- Extension ratings / reviews (metrics only)

---

## 10. Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

The minimum viable product is successful if:

1. [ ] Opens as standalone Qt Widgets app
2. [ ] Loads registry JSON from URL (GitHub raw)
3. [ ] Shows extension list with cards
4. [ ] Allows searching and filtering by category
5. [ ] Shows selected extension detail
6. [ ] Downloads ZIP with checksum verification
7. [ ] Extracts to local directory and registers as installed
8. [ ] Detects new available versions
9. [ ] Allows extension uninstallation
10. [ ] Works on Linux (Windows/macOS as stretch goal for MVP)

---

## 11. Data Formats

### 11.1 Registry JSON Schema

```json
{
  "registry_version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "unique-extension-id",
      "name": "Display Name",
      "description": "Short description",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "publisher": "Publisher Name",
      "website": "https://...",
      "repository": "https://github.com/...",
      "license": "SPDX identifier",
      "icon_url": "https://... (optional)",
      "category": "data_loader|data_streamer|parser|toolbox|bundle",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "version": "semver",
      "min_plotjuggler_version": "semver",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "name": "PluginClassName",
          "type": "plugin_type",
          "library": "library_name_without_extension"
        }
      ],
      "platforms": {
        "linux-x86_64": {
          "url": "https://...",
          "checksum": "sha256:..."
        }
      },
      "changelog": {
        "1.0.0": "Initial release"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 11.2 Installed State

There is no separate local state file. Installed extensions are discovered at runtime by
scanning `extensions_dir`, loading candidate plugin DSOs, and reading each DSO's embedded
plugin manifest. The marketplace never writes installed-state or plugin-manifest sidecars.
Windows staged updates use a transient `.pj_pending_install` intent file so restart-time
promotion can revalidate the staged DSO against the registry id/version that created it.

Fields read from the embedded plugin manifest:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `id` | Embedded plugin manifest key `"id"` |
| `version` | Embedded plugin manifest key `"version"` |
| `install_date` | Last-modified timestamp of the extension root directory |
| `path` | The scanned subdirectory itself |
| `enabled` | Always `true` by default (no persistence yet) |

### 11.3 Registry Extension Schema

```json
{
  "id": "extension-id",
  "version": "semver",
  "min_plotjuggler_version": "semver",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "PluginClassName",
      "type": "plugin_type",
      "library": "library_name",
      "ui_file": "optional_ui_file.ui"
    }
  ]
}
```
