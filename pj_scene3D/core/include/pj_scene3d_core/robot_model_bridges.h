// Helpers that turn a URDF's FIXED joints into static TF edges, so a robot model
// renders the links the data's /tf never places — e.g. a gripper rigidly mounted
// to an arm flange whose mount transform lives only in the URDF, not in /tf. Pure
// core: depends only on robot_model + the TF buffer (no Qt, no GL).
//
// Why FIXED joints only: a fixed joint has a constant transform, so it is a safe
// /tf_static-style edge. Movable joints (revolute/prismatic) need a joint-angle
// source and are deferred. The recording's own /tf always wins — injection is
// guarded so it never overrides a frame the data publishes.
