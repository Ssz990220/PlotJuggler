/// Wrap a plugin's C-ABI payload anchor as an sdk::BufferAnchor whose deleter
/// calls `anchor.release(anchor.ctx)` while HOLDING `library_keepalive` — the
/// producing plugin's DSO token.
///
/// Why the keepalive: `anchor.release` is a function pointer compiled into the
/// plugin's `.so`. A PayloadView / ResolvedObjectEntry carrying this anchor can
/// be cached past the point where the extension catalog dlcloses the plugin
/// (e.g. a scene widget destroyed after the session). Capturing the DSO token in
/// the deleter keeps the `.so` mapped until this anchor — and every copy — is
/// destroyed, so `release` is never invoked against unmapped code.
///
/// A null `anchor.release` yields an empty anchor (the buffer dies with the
/// C-ABI call; the caller must copy). A null `library_keepalive` is allowed and
/// reproduces the legacy behaviour (no DSO protection) for callers that have no
/// token to supply.
